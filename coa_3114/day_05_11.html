			<p class="reflection">
				When we arrived at Mycenae Monday morning, I wasn't really sure what I was looking at.  Even with the readings to help prepare me for the site, I hadn't really understood the significance of many of the features of the site, or even what was important to look for.  Once we were at the site and Thanos explained that the defensive walls, the megaron, and tholoi on site were the three most significant points to pay attention to, I was much better prepared to explore and understand the ruins.

				It was fascinating learning how to interpret the ruins, as well as learning how they had significance throughout different periods of history in Mycenaean and Greek culture.  Before this course, I had never realized that ancient civilizations would build structures on top of the ruins of civilizations that had come before them, as obvious as that may seem to me now.  It makes more sense to use what already exists as a foundation for new structures rather than to start from scratch all the time.

				Thanos pointed out how the landscape at the site was similar to the landscape of Athens and was well suited to be the center of a civilization.  The height of the citadel allows for the people of Mycenae to see intruders from far off, the surrounding mountains make it difficult for intruders to reach the valley, and the nearby coast makes for a port useful for trade and transportation.  It might be argued that some of these landscape features were mimicked in the construction of the city, such as the cyclopean walls imitating the natural rugged formation of the mountains.  These walls even imitate the function the mountains provided the city, providing a barrier to defend the citadel.

		<h2>Tholos Tombs</h2>

		<section>

			<p class="reflection ">
				While we were at Mycenae, we looked at three different tholoi: the Tomb of Aegisthus, the Tomb of Clytemnestra, and the Treasury of Atreus.  Each of these three tholoi are constructed using different techniques in different eras of Mycenaean history, and compared with each other and the even earlier grave circles on the site, you can begin to get a sense of the duration of the reign of the Mycenaean kingdom that existed here.  The presence of riches and precious metals in the grave circles on site indicate that the people buried here were important and possibly royal, but the fact that this is a grave circle rather than a tholos indicates that either the tholos was not yet being used for burials yet or that the individuals buried here were not considered important enough to be laid to rest in a tholos.  The latter possibility seems unlikely, however, as the proximity of the grave circles to the citadel indicates the significance of those buried here.

			<p class="reflection">
				The Tomb of Aegisthus has a fascinating construction that allows it to remain standing even after the upper part of the dome has collapsed.  This raises an interesting question; why weren't the other tholoi constructed in the same way?  It would make sense to prevent more damage than necessary in the event of a collapse.  However, the answer might lie in the fact that domes constructed later with a keystone supporting the structure were less likely to collapse at all.  Though the whole dome should collapse if the keystone were removed, the domes of the Tomb of Clytemnestra and of the Treasury of Atreus are still standing thousands of years after they were constructed.

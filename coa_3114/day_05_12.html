				Like many spaces that we would later encounter, the agora required using some imagination to put things back together and envision what things would have looked like and how people would have interacted in that environment in Ancient Athens.  I can imagine that there would have been a more mature and almost sophisticated air than that of the squares we encountered in present day Athens, given that there were no children allowed in the agora and that vendors were not allowed on the main diagonal.  I think that the real novel idea that the agora encompassed was that legal matters should be settled in a public space outdoors, not contained within the walls of a building.  When legal matters are settled before the general public, there is more accountability to what is said and how matters are handled.

				It is interesting that the tholos changed from being a place of burial to a place where prytaneis or senators would live.  This type of building still holds significance; maybe the kind of honor that used to be reserved for the dead was now being given to the living men who were serving their city by making legal decisions.

				The Temple of Hephaistos was particularly interesting to me, since my independent study deals with the classification of Greek temples.  Having read some of Vitruvius' writings on Greek temples helped a great deal with understanding what made each of the temples we visited unique, and this temple was the first site where I got to benefit from that knowledge.  One thing that stood out to me was the Doric frieze around the entablature of the temple; while the triglyphs of the frieze went all around the temple, the metopes of the frieze were only on the front, with four on either of the two sides of the temple adjacent to the front of the temple.  It was curious that the metopes would not continue all around the temple with the rest of the frieze.

				It was interesting to realize that the columns of the temple did not align with the walls of the cella.  The idea that a grid didn't exist until much later in history was hard to grasp, since they seem so basic to design.  Coming from a computer science background, I'm used to dealing with grids.  Every pixel on a computer screen is aligned in a grid.  Every 3D modeling software uses a system of grids, whether visible or hidden, to place objects in perceived space.  An array of arrays as a data structure can be visualized by using a table laid out as a grid.  Realizing that grids were not always used for these sorts of purposes helped me to realize how innovative of an idea the grid really is.

				The Acropolis Museum was definitely a highlight of the visit to Athens and made it possible for me to get more out of the visit to the Acropolis itself later that day.  Melissa asked me what I thought of the museum, and I told her something along the lines of how it creates a virtual space to experience the artifacts of the museum without distracting from them.  The way the windows let in only diffused white light and even the floors are frosted glass help to focus the attention of visitors on the sculptures and artifacts, not on the modern building.  Even the way the upper levels of the museum provide unobstructed views of the Acropolis makes the space inside the museum feel almost more imagined than real.  Mel said that I sounded like I was almost an architect from that kind of response; I think I sounded more like a video game designer.  Knowing that the museum is laid out to imitate the layout of the acropolis, I can almost imagine the Pantheon, Erechtheion, and Propylea melting into existence around the artifacts in the museum, as if a programmer had flipped a rendering switch on.  I don't think that I would have had that experience if I had not known how the museum was intended to parallel the Acropolis and gone inside expecting those parallels.

				Experiencing the sites of the different Greek temples was certainly an insight into the Greeks' perceptions of the personalities of their gods.  The Acropolis was certainly an example of this; the location on top of the mountain gives a view overlooking the whole city, hinting at Athena's wisdom and ability to see the big picture.  The exposure of the rock to the bright sun and harsh winds also added to the sense that there must be a powerful presence nearby.

				It was surprising to learn that the Erechtheion, not the Parthenon, was constructed on top of the megaron.  I would have expected the Parthenon to be the more significant temple, since prior to the trip I had heard a great deal more about the Parthenon than the Erechtheion.  This may be due to the fact that the Parthenon is larger and more like an ideal Greek temple; it has a symmetrical layout and a peristyle portico, features that are likely to come to mind when the layman thinks of Greek temples.  However, over the course of this trip I have come to appreciate the irregularities of temples as features that set them apart and should make them stand out compared to others.

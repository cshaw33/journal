			<p class="reflection">
				As a pragmatist who has never been particularly invested in sports, I thought that it was curious that things like stadiums and theaters would be deemed necessary for a city to truly be a city.  Having that pointed out to me now, I can understand why that is the case though.  Theaters and stadiums were necessary in the same way they are still necessary today; people like to be entertained and they like to create art.  The modern stadium includes physical stadiums as well as sports networks, fantasy sports, and any other means of including athletics in one’s life.  We can extend the concept of the modern theater to include other mediums, such as TV shows, movies, even music.  The content of modern entertainment may tend to be less intellectual than ancient entertainment, but the necessity for the mind to be stimulated with content conveying morals and philosophies is still a part of the human experience.

			<p class="reflection">
				It seems strange that the Temple of the Olympian Zeus was worked on for hundreds of years before it was completed and dedicated by Hadrian in AD 132.  Since then, the cella and many of its 104 columns have been disassembled.  Modern visitors to the site are only able to see 13 of the original 104 columns still standing.  However, what remains standing of the temple gives a glimpse into its former majesty.  Here, we are reminded of the tranquil personality of Zeus by the peaceful setting of the temple.

			</figure>
		</section>
		<section>
			<p class="reflection">
				The site of the Olympeion is also associated with a change in people’s attitudes towards ancient ruins in the era of Romanticism.  It makes sense to people in the modern world that the remains of historic sites should be preserved for future generations, but this is a thought that was relatively new to the romantics.  It is strange to think of temples as a set of pieces that are waiting to be used for some other purpose, but that must be how they were seen by the rulers who tore down the columns of this temple to repurpose them.

				Throughout the week in Athens, it was apparent that the Acropolis is central to the city.  It acts as a central point to navigate around, and whenever we got lost, we were able to find our way by walking towards the Acropolis.  Walking along the Peripatos, the importance of the Acropolis in ancient times was also apparent.  The retaining walls of the top of the hill tower over the path winding up to the Propylaea, enhancing the majesty and importance of this place.

			<p class="reflection">
				Returning to the Acropolis, we had the chance to go behind the scenes with Petros Georgopolis, a marble sculptor who has worked on the restoration of the Propylaea for several decades.  This was a valuable opportunity to see the effort and techniques that make rebuilding this structure possible.  A lot of care goes into reattaching a single fragment of a column capital that has been damaged.

				In ancient times, Eleusis was known for its mystery cult that centered around the myth of Persephone and Hades.  An important aspect of this cult that set it apart was the idea of the resurrection of the dead, or return of a soul from the underworld.  Cult rituals would take place here in a building called the Telesterion, the most holy place on site.  The rituals would involve partaking of a hallucinogenic drink called Kykeon.

				Eleusis was another site that was hard to envision what had been there.  It was also getting to be somewhat difficult to stay focused and engaged after the past three days of absorbing a wealth of information about the history of Greece and spending most of those three days on my feet.  It was still interesting to learn about the mystery cult that was practiced there and the honor that was associated with being asked to join such a cult.  The telesterion itself is fascinating to compare to other places people would gather; porticos and stoas were designed to be open to the air, while the telesterion was designed to be able to completely close off all light.

				Brauron is the site of the Sanctuary of Artemis, a site where many young girls would come to be dedicated to Artemis.  Like we had already seen the character of Zeus reflected in the site of the Temple of the Olympian Zeus and the character of Athena reflected in the Acropolis, we could see the character of Artemis in the site at Brauron.  It makes sense that Artemis the huntress would want to be in the mountains, but this also makes her the perfect choice of the Greek goddesses to be the patron of young girls.  Since Artemis is already in the mountains, away from the business of the city, the site of her sanctuary naturally offers more protection from any ill will that might befall the girls she is meant to protect.  Artemis is also a capable warrior and would have made for an ideal role model for girls to look up to.

		<h2>Cape Sounion</h2>

		<section class="pano" style="background-image: url('../images/pano/514_sounion_panorama_2.jpg')"></section>

			<p class="reflection">
				The highlight of the day was traveling to Cape Sounion.  We were all pretty tired by that point, but the site of the temple surrounded by breathtaking views of the sea brought back the energy needed to take in the site.  Learning about the character of Poseidon from the site, we can tell that he would have a powerful and dramatic personality, judging by the roaring of the waves and the steep cliffs that his temple is built upon.  The view was particularly dramatic at the time of day we were there, with the bright sun starting to lower in the sky and reflecting off the sea behind the temple.  I can see why this temple was romanticized by the likes of Lord Byron and other romantics.

			<p class="reflection">
				Although Sounion was a military town, like Mycenae, the two sites felt very different.  Mycenae was all about defenses, with the mountains surrounding the city and the defensive walls surrounding the citadel.  Sounion, on the other hand, seems to stand confidently in the open, with itâ€™s main defensive advantages being the steep cliffs that line the coast and the ability to see approaching ships from far off.  The site of the temple of Poseidon is particularly prominent, standing out from the rest of the coastline by casting a dramatic silhouette against the sky.  Rather than aiming to protect itself, the purpose of Sounion was to warn Athens when ships were approaching by use of fryktoria, or signal towers.  This defensive strategy indicates that the Greeks recognized the importance of quickly spreading information to prepare to defend the city rather than relying on brute force alone.

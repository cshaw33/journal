			<p class="reflection">
				Due to the presence of many small children in the museum on Friday and due to trying to avoid them, I inadvertently ended up going through the exhibits in the museum backwards.  As a result, since the museum was ordered by period in Greek history, I ended up with the experience of going backwards through time.  This reminded me of what Thanos mentioned on Wednesday of the Greeks’ notion of time being represented by walking backwards.  This hadn’t made sense to me at the time, but in the museum I came to understand what it meant.  In the Greek concept of remembering the past, you must be facing backwards because you cannot retain memory of something you are not facing.  In this model of experiencing time, more things become visible as one moves through time.  In my experience of moving backwards through time periods in the museum, I had the opposite experience of starting with the full picture and seeing elements removed.

			<p class="reflection">
				From this perspective, I started with how the story of Ancient Greece would end with the Roman Empire extending into Greece and rulers such as Hadrian being invested here.  Moving through the museum, Roman influences dropped off, and what remained were statues of Greek gods, with later ones such as Asklepios seen sooner and earlier gods such as Poseidon and Zeus encountered multiple times in statues and reliefs.  Continuing into earlier periods of Greek history, some geometric motifs that had been recurring disappeared.
			</p>
		
			<p class="reflection">
				It was exciting to realize that I was starting to be able to recognize the differences in sculptures from different periods and make connections between the influences in those periods.  For example, similarities can be seen between the postures of early Greek statues and even older statues from ancient Egypt.  This matches up with the influence of Mycenaean culture on early Greek culture, and the influence of Egyptian culture on Mycenaean culture prior to that.

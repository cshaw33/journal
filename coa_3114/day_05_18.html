			<p>The Temple of Apollo Epicurius in Bassae was absolutely one of my favorite sites of the trip. There are so many fascinating details about this temple that make it stand out from what Greek temples normally look like, which makes it feel more special and strange to experience.  The temple faces North, unlike most Greek temples which are usually East-West oriented.  The temple is elongated from normal dimensions, being 6 x 15 rather than the expected 6 x 13.  This is characteristic of archaic temples, making this temple feel more ancient than it really is.  This temple housed what may have been the first Corinthian column, and had all three classical orders of Doric, Ionic and Corinthian present in the temple.  The columns inside the cella of the temple are engaged Ionic columns, with diagonal capitals rather than standard Ionic capitals.  Two of these engaged columns are engaged at angles, a feature that is extremely rare.  A door opens to the side of the temple facing East just next to where the altar would have been.  Strangely, the frieze of the temple is located inside the cella rather than outside, and the panels have been mixed so that the exact order cannot be determined.  Finally, we can tell from the unfinished edges on the base that construction of the temple was not finished when it was abandoned, adding to the mystery.  The region of Arcadia with its dramatic mountains and occasional earthquakes also adds to the drama associated with the temple of Apollo.</p>

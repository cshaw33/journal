			<h1>May 19: Olympia</h1>

			<p>Getting to experience being at the site of the first Olympics and to run a race there was a really unique opportunity.  It was also interesting to learn that the Greek calendar starts in the same year that the first Olympics were held.  This points to the importance of the transitional period Greece was in at the time the Olympics were started.  A new era where every four years (or once an Olympiad), all of Greece would come together, there would be no fighting, and instead the physical accomplishments of athletes would be appreciated and celebrated.  This was truly a significant time period for Greece.  There are other transitional periods represented at the site as well.  The transition to a culture centered on gods started in part here in the early 5th century B.C. with the construction of the Temple of Hera, the most ancient surviving temple in Greece.  Another transition that is also evidenced at this site is the later movement away from the sanctity of temples, shown by the presence of statues of the family members of Alexander the Great in the Philippeion.  Given that people from all over Greece regularly gathered here for the Olympic games, it makes sense that there would be evidence of change in Greek culture found here from many different periods in Greek history. </p>

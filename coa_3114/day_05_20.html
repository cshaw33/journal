			<h1>May 20: Delphi</h1>

			<p>Given that the temple of Apollo in Arcadia was surrounded by a dramatic mountainous landscape,  it made sense that there would be a similar landscape at the sanctuary of Apollo at Delphi.  At both places the mountains have extremely steep slopes and an air of mystery that was associated with them in ancient times.  Arcadia’s mysterious air came from its isolation from the rest of Greece, along with its archaic cultural practices.  On the other hand, Delphi’s mysterious air was literal gas that would come out of the ground.  There are other features that the two sites share, such as the 6 by 15 temples that follow an archaic standard for dimensions. </p>

			<p>One of the main differences between the two sites was probably the amount of visitors that each received.  Most of the visitors to the temple of Apollo in Arcadia were probably from nearby, due to the site’s isolation.  However, because of the importance of the oracle, there were many more visitors to the sanctuary and temple of Apollo at Delphi.</p>

			<p>The presence of both Apollo and Dionysus here representing reason and passion respectively makes for an interesting contrast.  These are not necessarily two gods that I would expect to get along or even to find at the same site, but that is exactly what we find here.  The one thing they have in common though is that they are patrons of the arts.  This does make sense, especially considering that the purpose of entertainment in the Greek theater was to educate enlighten.  We could hypothesize that Apollo was an advocate for the enlightenment that the arts provide, while Dionysus was more interested in the passionate emotional displays that the actors and declaimers would perform here.</p>

			<p>I find it curious that Apollo was known as Apollo the Slanted because of the instances when the predictions of the oracle did not come true.  Being the god of light, I would expect him to be associated with truth and not deception. </p>

			<p>It’s interesting that the muses are at the top of the Gradus ad Parnassum and not at the bottom.  It would make more sense to me that the muses would be the ones to guide the artist to the point of mastery, helping the artist to become the master from the very beginning.  However, if we make the Gradus ad Parnassum into a parable for achieving the mastery of a skill, there is a lot of work that must be done by the artist on his own before he comes to the point of receiving inspiration from the muses.  Perhaps the ancient Greeks thought that the muses were meant to inspire content worthy of a master in the minds of artists who they deemed worthy rather than granting mastery of artistic techniques to make those artists worthy of being masters of their art. </p>

			<h1>May 21: Delos</h1>
		</section>
		<section>

			<p>Delos is famous in Greek mythology as the birthplace of Apollo and Artemis.  When Hera the wife of Zeus found out that Leto was pregnant Leto was forced to come to the island of Delos to give birth in secret.  Because the island is the birthplace of Apollo, there were several temples to Apollo built here over the years.</p>

			<p>Delos was a site that had ruins that were difficult to decypher at times, and yet it was by far one of my favorite days of the trip.  Something about how the waters here have stayed crystal blue and how the island feels untouched by modern culture makes it a special place. </p>

			<p>The presence of a frieze on the stoa where the agora used to be is interesting and raises several possibilities for the direction the culture of the island was changing at the time it was constructed.  The residents of Delos could have been moving away from the sanctity of religion, taking away the significance of temples by using features that had been reserved for temples elsewhere.  The opposite might also be true: while maintaining the sanctity of religion, the people of Delos might have simply been celebrating the importance of the public space of the agora by adding religious significance to it.</p>

			<p>Another place we see a change in the way architectural features are used is on triglyphs: the head of a bull is added to a triglyph as decoration.  Coming into this trip, not knowing the difference between a doric and ionic frieze, I would not have found that to be significant.  However, after almost two weeks of looking at buildings with unanimously unadorned triglyphs, finding a triglyph that has decoration on it stood out.</p>

			<p>It is apparent that Delos was considered an important city to Greece.  One feature of the city that reveals this is the Palaestrum.  According to Vitruvius, the Palaestrum is an important feature of Greek cities, providing bathrooms, a young mensâ€™ hall, and even rooms with seats for intellectual discussions.  Other features of the city that reveal its importance are its stadium and sewage system.</p>

			<p>Like sites we have already seen such as the temple of Apollo in Arcadia, the most interesting parts of Delos to me were the oddities left behind that show evidence of a changing society.  I think this is because learning to pick up on those oddities, like finding friezes and colonnades in unexpected places for example, was a new skill to me.  </p>

			<h1>May 25: Akrotiri</h1>

			<p>Akrotiri is an ancient city found on the island of Santorini.  This name is a convention given by scholars while the name it was known by in ancient times goes unknown.  It is clear that it was a major city though, as is indicated by the presence of features such as a sewage system and public buildings.  Similarly to Pompeii, the city was covered in ashe by a volcano, and much of the city has been preserved as a result, providing a window into what a Bronze Age city looked like.  The city is organically laid out, with almost no streets at right angles.  Common building plans were used throughout the city, which indicates that the people who lived in those dwellings were of the same social class.  Despite the presence of a sewer, there is no evidence of a water supply, although it is possible that fresh water came in from a spring. </p>

			<p>We learned a good deal about Greece during the Bronze Age before we arrived at the archaeological site.  It was fascinating for me to learn that during this era sculptures became less realistic than those that had previously been made.  It is curious that artisans would move away from realism in favor of sculptures that are more like caricatures.  There could be several reasons for this change in preference.  It could be that the community of artisans making these sculptures was small enough and isolated from the pressures of other groups of artisans that they had the freedom to create more stylized works.  This type of separation is also what made innovations possible at places like Arcadia and the Greek Colonies.  However, this only answers the question of how this stylization was socially possible, and not why it was preferred.  It could simply be that certain features that were highlighted in these sculptures, such as long necks and angular features, were deemed more attractive to the citizens of Akrotiri. </p>

			<p>Another interesting point made at Akrotiri is that the first depictions of animals in art were made here.  Prior to the earliest pottery depicting birds, the only natural elements depicted in art had been floral patterns.  I would hypothesize that floral patterns existed in ancient art before depictions of animals because they were better suited to the styles of decoration that already existed at that time.  Early decorations on pottery have no real figure or subject matter, only geometric patterns.  Meanders and other motifs with symmetry along a linear axis have no single focal point, and the decoration simply acts as noise, making the piece more interesting.  For more innovative artisans who want to imitate nature in this style of decoration, flowers and leaves make for an obvious choice since they have a similar rhythm in nature.  Eventually, as patterns of decoration become more complex, these patterns may have begun to develop more obvious focal points.  These points allow for spaces to represent images that are not necessarily symmetrical, such as animals.  However, this is merely a hypothesis of how the process of transitioning from geometric motifs to images of animals might have occurred.  There is much more to that story that we may never know, about the interactions between artisans of the day and the requests made by the people who commissioned them to make art. </p>

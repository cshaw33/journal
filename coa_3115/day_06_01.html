				Our hotel, the Albergio del Solle, is built into the remains of the Theater of Pompey.  The theater was the first to be built in Rome and was built at a time when theaters were not a part of Roman culture.  To make this Greek building acceptable to Roman citizens, a temple to Venus Victrix was included in the theater as the highest point in the structure.

				The Largo di Torre Argentina is a square with the remains of four temples.  Temple C is the oldest of the four, with features of Etruscan architecture.  Temple B is a tholos, with only 6 columns remaining.

				The Church of Il Gesu is the the first Jesuit church.  Designed by Vignola in the late Renaissance.  The interior has no side aisles, as the space is designed for sermons.  The spectacular ceiling is meant to offer visitors a view into heaven.

				The Altar of the Fatherland, or the <i>Altare della Patria</i> was Constructed in the late 19th century to celebrate Italy as a united country.  On the main steps leading up to the building ther is an equestrian statue of Vittorio Emanuele II, the first king of United Italy.  Victory is personified in chariots on top of the building.  The building itself is designed to resemble an open-air altar and is located at the end of the historic Imperial Forum.

				The Temple of Portunus, the god of the harbor, is possibly the only example of a true pseudoperipteral temple we encountered on the trip.  This means that instead of having columns around the outside of the temple creating a screened space around the cella, ornamental half-columns are placed against the walls of the cella.  Since this illusion can best be seen from the front, it makes sense for this style to be present in Roman temples, which are characterized by having a frontal design, rather than in Greek temples, which are designed to be appreciated from all sides.

				One of the first things we learned about Roman culture when we arrived in Rome was that theaters were originally disliked because of their association with the immorality of Greek culture.  It is fascinating that dislike of a culture would result in dislike of a particular building type, which does not inherently cause immorality and is useful for providing an audience with a clear view of a public speaker.  However, recently I learned of a similar case of culture aversion: in 2013, the British navy began using the music of Britney Spears to ward off Somalian pirates.  This technique worked because of the pirates’ strong dislike for American culture.  Perhaps the ancient Romans’ aversion for Greek culture is similar to this anecdotal story.

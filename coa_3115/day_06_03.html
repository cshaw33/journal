			<p>
				The Colosseum is really a marvel of engineering, considering everything that the Romans were able to implement there.  I had always been told how impressive the system of arches that supported it was, but I had never understood why these arches were any more impressive than other arches.  Now that I have been introduced to the concepts of tension, compression, and using buttressing to maintain the compression needed to support the arch, I can appreciate the ingenuity that it took to implement a self-buttressing elliptical arcade.  The support for the building is not the only engineering marvel shown off in the Colosseum.  I can imagine that the velarium used to provide shade for the crowd would be difficult to implement in a way that it could be moved while there were people sitting in the amphitheater.  The hypogeum is also a particularly amazing structure that I think would be fascinating to see reproduced.  There is also the efficiency of the way the Romans were able to move crowds through the Colosseum quickly, a feature that modern visitors to the site are unable to appreciate due to the ticket office and turnstiles that they are required to enter and exit through.

				The Arch of Titus was constructed around 80 AD to commemorate the defeat of the Jews in Palestine and the Sack of the Jerusalem temple.  Two friezes are depicted on the inside of the arch, one depicting spoils being carried off from Jerusalem and the other depicting Titus being crowned by Nike.  The first frieze is meant to make those passing through the arch feel as if they are walking alongside the soldiers depicted.  Though Titus was only emperor for two years from AD 79 to 81, the Sack of Jerusalem happened while he was a general in the Roman military.

		<h2>The Arch of Constantine</h2>

				The Arch of Constantine was constructed between AD 312 and 315 to commemorate a victory against co-ruler Maxentius at the Milvian Bridge on the Tiber river.  This arch is notable for its use of spolia, or sculpture that have been re-used from other decorated structures.  The spolia on the Arch of Constantine are thought to be re-used from works sponsored by Trajan.

				At the forum of Augustus, we saw the remains of exedra.  Exedra are semicircular recesses sometimes set into the facade of a building.  These structures were used in the Forum of Augustus as fixed courtrooms.  These spaces were overlooked by the Summi Viri, or statues of "Great Men"
			</p>
			<p>
				Trajan's column was constructed to commemorate a victory in Romania over the Dacians.  This victory held importance because it meant that Rome had new control over gold mines.  The column originally held a statue of Trajan on top, but the statue was later replaced with a sculpture of St. Peter.  The column is adorned with a remarkable continuous frieze that wraps twenty-three times around the column starting from the bottom and continuing all the way to the top.  In exception to a Roman law that states there should be no burials inside the city walls, the ashes of Trajan were originally buried inside a chamber at the base of the column.
			</p>
			<p>
				The markets of Trajan were an important commercial space in the city.  There were five levels of shops, where each identical shop had two levels, a lower space to trade and sell goods and an upper level to act as storage space.  The markets are located behind the Forum of Augustus, and the curved streets that run through the space follow the curve of the Exedra.

		<h2> The Pantheon</h2>

				The Pantheon is a temple to all the gods of Rome built by Hadrian around AD 120.  Some would say it is a temple to all the gods plus Hadrian himself.  The building is a rotunda with a hemispherical dome.  Despite its round cella, this is clearly a frontal temple.  It has no peristyle and the sides of the cella are bare, but the front of the Pantheon has a porch cleverly designed to hide the height of the interior from view.
			</p>

			<p>
				The space inside can be separated vertically between three zones.  The first is the lowest level at eye level with visitors.  This level is defined by the niches that create the horizontal and diagonal axes in this space.  These niches have the purpose of holding sculpture but also have the added effect of creating a more interesting pattern of the walls advancing towards and receding away from the central space.  The second zone features more niches, directly above the niches in the first zone but also in between them.  The third zone of the vertical axis is the dome itself, characterized by having five (5) rows of twenty-eight (28) coffers each.
			</p>
			<p>
				The inside is a space that is mathematically balanced in many ways.  One of these ways is its hemispherical dome of the same height as the walls that support it.  This means that a perfect sphere can be inscribed into the interior of the Pantheon.  There are several defining axes in the interior space.  There is the vertical axis from the center of the room through the oculus at the top of the dome, a secondary axis from the entrance to the apse, and also horizontal and diagonal axes created by niches directly across from each other.  All of these axes converge at the very center of the room under the oculus.
			</p>

			<p>
				The differences in the division of space in the dome compared to the lower levels of the interior space also align visitors subconsciously towards the apse.  The dome is divided radially into twenty-eight (28) equal sections, while the niches at the lower levels are divided into eight (8) equal sections.  The only places these two divisions of space align are at the entrance and at the apse, both on the cardinal axis of the room.

			<p>Ostia was a small town  located at the mouth of the Tiber river to the South West of Rome.  Originally a military castrum, Ostia grew to become an important port with many features of a Roman city.  Large seagoing ships would sail to Ostia where their goods would be transferred to smaller boats able to travel up the Tiber to Rome. </p>

			<h2>Piazzale della Corporazioni</h2>

			<p>The majority of the trade that occurred at Ostia would have taken place at the Piazzale delle Corporazioni.  Simple black and white mosaics decorate the ground where there would have been shops in Roman times.  These shops may have been where the goods, services, or even animals depicted in these mosaics were sold.  Alternatively, they may have merely been offices responsible for dealing with the trade of these things.  Many of the mosaics feature exotic animals, such as deer, elephants, and giraffes, most of which would be sent to Rome for events in the Colosseum. </p>

			<h2>Horrea</h2>
			<p>Many of the resources Rome needed to support its citizens were stored in Horrea, or storehouses, in Ostia.  Horrea were composed of rooms called Cubicula, which could either be arranged with a courtyard in the middle or in rows back to back to each other.  The doorways to cubicula were narrow in order to let less light, keeping the contents cooler and more fresh.  When cubicula were used to house liquids, such as olive oil or wine, the amphorae used to hold those liquids were placed in the ground to aid with cooling.  When grain was stored in cubicula, it would be placed on a raised floor, allowing air to circulate underneath and keep the grain fresh.</p>

			<h2> The House of Diana</h2>
			<p>The House of Diana is one of the insulae or apartment buildings in Ostia.  This building would not only be a place where many people lived, but there is also space for merchants to sell their goods on the ground floor.  The building was probably 3 stories high, with the tenants of the building roughly separated by class.  Dwellings closer to the ground floor would have been considered more desirable for their easier access to the street, which would have been a social place for many of the tenants and merchants who lived and worked here.</p>

			<h2> Nero and Ostia</h2>
			<p>
				Having grown up in a Christian household and being educated with the history of the early church, I had only ever heard negative things about Nero as an emperor of Rome who oppressed the early church and executed thousands of Christians.  Those may be true facts, but it was interesting to learn about a different, slightly more sane side of Nero.  Whether or not he was responsible for the conflagration of Rome, the building codes he created in response made the city a safer place for its citizens.  Here in Ostia, we learned that Nero required ships returning to Ostia from Rome carry rubble out of the city with them.  This solved two problems at once: the city was cleaned up and the rubble was used to build up protection for the harbor against storms.  Like the building codes that resulted from the conflagration, this policy was also in response to a disaster, a storm that sank around two-hundred (200) ships.  Even if Nero was an insane emperor, he did institute several policies that greatly benefitted its citizens.

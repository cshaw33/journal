			<p>Hadrian was born  in AD 76 in Spain.  At the time, Vespasian was Roman emperor, followed by Titus, Domitian, Nerva, and Trajan.  Towards the end of the reign of Domitian, Hadrian joined the army at age 19.  Trajan and Hadrian grew close during Trajan's time as emperor, and just before his death Trajan, having no heir, named Hadrian emperor.</p>

			<p>Hadrian was known for his eccentricities, namely he was a Philhellene, or a lover of Greek culture.  This love of all things Greek was present in Hadrian's life in many ways.  Hadrian spoke Greek, became a part of the mystery cult at Eleusis, and had a fascination with Greek architecture.  Despite having a wife, Hadrian also had a male lover named Antinous, who coincidentally happened to be from Greece.</p>

			<p>Hadrian's Villa is an example of a country villa.  The complex is made up of about 30 buildings, some of which are thought to have been designed by Hadrian himself.  The villa centers around an artificial island called the Maritime Theater, which acted like a private retreat for Hadrian within the villa itself.</p>

			<p>The Canopus Canal is a feature of the villa named after a city in Egypt near Alexandria.  In addition to Greek influences, there are several features of the villa inspired by other exotic cultures.  The Canopus canal with its Serapeum is an example of this.  Rather than being an imitation of something from another culture, the canal combines and reinvents features and incorporates influences from Greek architecture.  A colonnade curves around the end, but with a curved and arched entablature above.  Sculptures of nude figures are framed below these curved entablatures.  Along one side of the canal is a series of karyatids and atlantids, while the remains of simple columns line the other.  The Serapeum at the end of the canal is an artificial grotto and shrine to the Egyptian god Serapis.  This shrine would have had a subterranean space, while the space above ground was roofed by a pumpkin dome, a style of dome thought to have been created by Hadrian himself.</p>

			<p>Due to his interest with Greek culture, Hadrian is someone whose influence we have seen since the beginning of the trip in Athens.  Evidence of this can be seen in Hadrian's library, which he commissioned, and the temple of the Olympian Zeus, which he completed the construction of.  Another structure, Hadrian's Arch, which was built to thank Hadrian for what he had done for the city, even declares Athens to be Hadrian's city.  Because Hadrian was invested in Greek culture, his influence in Greece turned out to be helpful as a reference point for me personally when it came to understanding where the timelines for Greek and Roman culture overlapped. </p>

			<p>While we were at Hadrian's Villa, Laura asked us to think about what kinds of features we would include in our own retreat spaces.  Some of the features I thought of were dramatic staircases, rooms for relaxing, views of the sunrise and sunset, and of course a kitchen.  I thought that this was an interesting exercise that helped to make sense of the types of features that we encountered at all of the villas we visited on the trip.  Understanding the purposes of the features of a villa also helps to understand the character of the individuals who commissioned these villas.  In the same way that the Greeks constructed temples in locations and styles that catered to the gods or goddesses to whom the temples were dedicated, villas are also cultivated to the tastes of the owners of the villa.  For example, being a lover of all things Greek, there were many Greek influences to be found at Hadrian's villa.  It is also apparent that Hadrian liked to get away from everything, not only from the fact that his villa is located a good ways away from the city but also because it has the Maritime Theater as an even more secluded space inside, guarded by high walls and a moat.</p>

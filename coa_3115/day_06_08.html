			<h2>Church of St Agnes Catacombs</h2>

			<p>There were more than one hundred different catacombs around the outside of the city of Rome in which many people from the early church were buried.  Burial was extremely important to Christians, since they believed that for their bodies to be resurrected at the second coming of Christ they should be preserved.</p>

			<p>It seems strange to me that there would be funerary banquets held in honor of the deceased inside the catacombs themselves.  Even if there was less of a stigma associated with death, there was still enough of a stigma that the Roman government would not allow burials inside the city.</p>

			<h2>Mausoleum of Constantina</h2>

			<p>The Mausoleum of Constantina felt like a holy space when we walked inside in a different way from the other churches we visited.  While other churches can feel noisy with an abundance of decoration going on and overwhelming due to the vast size of the nave, the Mausoleum was small and simple.  There was decoration, but it did not detract from the sanctity of the space.  The structure is round, creating a space that is centralized, with the upper level letting in light from the outside.  This feature especially helps this space to feel like a small doorway into heaven, with the distractions and petty worries of the world blocked out and the simple thought remaining that what matters eternally is to have faith in God.</p>

			<h2>Church of Santa Sabina</h2>

			<p>Many of the early churches were away from the city center of Rome.  This is because there was land available for use here, and there was less competition with the temples set up at the forum.  This is true of Santa Sabina, located on the Aventine hill.  Because Christianity was a new faith, Christians chose to differentiate the buildings they congregated in from Roman temples by using a relatively new building type, the basilica.  This thought process still happens today, with startup businesses that try to create living workspaces to differentiate themselves from the typical cubical office, though Iâ€™m sure the implications for early churches were less whimsical than those for offices.  Unlike temples, church basilicas were meant to be appreciated from the inside, thus this is where the most decoration can be found. </p>

			<h2>Church of Santa Maria Trastevere</h2>

			<p>At the Church of Santa Maria in Trastevere, we talked about the cult of the Virgin Mary in the early church.  Since Christ was divine, it was hard for many early christians to think of Mary as not also being divine, and many regarded her as the queen of heaven. </p>

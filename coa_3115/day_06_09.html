			<h3>Septimius Severus</h3>

			</figure>

			<p>I was drawn to this piece because of the interesting and beautiful way it combines materials, using marble for the head and alabaster for the cloak around the shoulders of the bust.  It is a reminder that not all parts of a sculpture need to come from the same piece of stone, which allows for flexibility of design and creates more design choices to make when bringing a conceptualized sculpture to life.</p>

			<h3>Bacchic Crater</h3>

			<p>I took notice of the Bacchic Crater because of the presence of sculpture where it would not have normally been found in Ancient Greek culture.  This is a distinction between the Greeks, who seldom put sculpture on parts of buildings other than the pediment and entablature, and there is only one known amphorae that we have seen on this trip that had sculpture on it.  The use of sculpture on containers may have become normal by 1200, after several hundred years of experimentation.  </p>

			<h3>Leone</h3>

				<figcaption>Sculpture of a Lion</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>This sculpture of a lion (which had no date posted with it or much information about it) reminded me of the lions statues we saw at Delos and the lions gate at Mycenae.  These animals have been depicted in sculpture since the beginning of sculpture itself, and yet they have been depicted has changed dramatically.  This could be due to several reasons.  Sculpting ability has certainly improved over the centuries, as masterpieces are created and studied and new techniques are crafted and taught to others.  But I think that for depictions of lions specifically, sculptors did not have the first-hand experience of seeing a lion close up, in order to take note of the details necessary to create a realistic statue.  By the time of the Roman Empire, sculptors would simply be able to go to the nearest amphitheater to witness all kinds of exotic animals there as inspiration for their sculpting, rather than working on a secondhand account of what another sculptor thinks a lion looks like. </p>

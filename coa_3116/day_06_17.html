			<p>The Piazza del Campo is the main square of the city of Siena, located at the convergence of several roads in the middle of the city.  This semicircular space is almost conical, with the ground sloping toward the center of the piazza.  The square has been paved with a herringbone pattern separated into nine different segments, one for each of the neighborhoods of Siena.  The square is big enough that the population of the entire city would have been able to fit in it.  Siena had strict building codes regarding ornamentation.  At one point, the basilica was even torn down because it was too ornamented.  Since then, the Cathedral of Siena has been constructed on the site of the old Basilica.  </p>

			<h3> Siena Cathedral</h3>

			<p> The Siena Cathedral faced many structural issues in its construction.  The supports on the facade of the church do not line up, and lateral forces from the arches created the danger of the arches collapsing.  Side towers were built to counter these lateral forces, but the towers were too heavy to be supported by the ground.  </p>

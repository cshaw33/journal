			<h2>Basilica di San Lorenzo</h2>

			<p>The Basilica of San Lorenzo is one of Brunelleschi’s works commissioned by the Medici family.  This was done as a political move to attempt to win back the favor of the public, who tended to dislike the Medicis for essentially being in control of the city.  The outside of the building is insightful because it offers a view of what a church looks like without a facade.  I find it humorous that the facade was never decided on or built for the church, seeing as how the interior is handsomely decorated.  The complicated geometrical relationships on the inside of the Basilica are emphasized by the lines on the floor of the interior. </p>

			<h2>Laurentian Library</h2>

			<p>Michelangelo’s Laurentian Library is a fascinating space to experience.  The entrance to the library is a tightly packed and seemingly unnecessarily tall space that makes the visitor feel drawn upward, in order to relieve the tension collected at the base of the staircase leading inside.  The stairs themselves are sculpted like lava, pouring forth out of the mouth of the library.  This seems an odd choice when designing a space intended to draw people into the library, though it does add to the majesty of the room. </p>

			<h2>Palazzo Medici Riccardi</h2>

			<p>The Palazzo Medici Riccardi was the residential place of the Medici family.  Michelangelo was the architect for the building, though he worked on schemes developed by Brunelleschi.  The outer facade of the building features a gradient of rustication, with more rustication closer to the ground.  This contributes to perceptually adding height to the building when viewed from the outside; since the eye would normally expect the same amount of rustication for the entire building, it appears as though the less rusticated sections higher up are further away than they actually are. </p>

			<h2>Ospedale degli Innocenti</h2>

			<p>The Ospedale degli Innocenti, or Hospital of the Innocents, was Brunelleschi’s first project.  Characteristic of Brunelleschi’s early works, the principles of classical architecture are applied, but not exactly the way they are meant to.  The Columns on the side bend to form the architrave rather than having these two be distinct, for example.  On the other side of this piazza, the facade of the building directly across was later changed to be a mirror image of Brunelleschi’s facade.  </p>

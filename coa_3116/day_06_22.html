			<h2>Sagrestia Nuova</h2>

			<p>The Sagrestia Nuova was one of my favorite places to visit because of the remarkable sculpture by Michelangelo on the tombs of Giuliano and Lorenzo Medici.  The symbolism involved in these two tombs reflects the personalities of the two men while complementing each other in a balanced way.  Giuliano is seen dressed for battle in a corselet, looking anxiously around his surroundings, almost as if he is about to rise from his seated position.  Lorenzo on the other hand is content to remain seated, quietly staring blankly into the distance while settled comfortably in his chair.</p>

			<p>The figures accompanying these men also compliment their personalities.  With Giuliano, there are figures representing day and night, stark opposites of each other.  Both of their forms are twisted dramatically in opposite directions from each other in guarded positions.  Accompanying Lorenzo on the other hand are dawn and dusk.  These figures have opened themselves up in vulnerable positions and seem to be more like mirrors of each other than opposites.  Dawn appears to be coming aware of his surroundings, while dusk is slipping off to sleep, while also almost slipping off the tomb she decorates.</p>

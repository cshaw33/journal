			<h2>Palladio</h2>
			
			<p>Much of the city of Vicenza was designed by Palladio, who became a highly influential architect during his lifetime due to the invention of the printing press.  Palladio published the first guidebook on Roman architecture in a time when many people were fascinated by creating fantasy worlds like in antiquity.  Palladio was trained as an architect but not as an artist, unlike many architects who came before him who were trained as both.  </p>

			<p>Palladio's last project was the Teatro Olimpico, a correct Roman theater.  Although the theater is roofed, it is painted to feel as though it were outside.  The background for the stage is a three-dimensional false perspective of a scene from Oedipus Rex, the first performance  staged there.  </p>

			<h2>Villa Rotunda</h2>

		<section>

			<p>Palladio's villas are characterized by balance and symmetry.  Whenever there is a feature on one side of the villa, you will find that same feature on the other side.  The Villa Rotunda is no exception to this rule, having reflection symmetry across eight axes.  This four-sided villa has a central space that can theoretically inscribe a sphere, much like the Pantheon in Rome.  </p>

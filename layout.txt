Idea for layout for Journal site:

Home page: links to get to 3114, 3115, 3116:

	3114:

		Different page for Each Day.  (hopefully. Lots of picures and sketches to make this happen) 


OUtline of how the file structure for this needs to be set up:
Journal
	index.html
	coa_3114
		05_11
		05_12
		05_13
		etc.
	coa_3115
		dates
	coa_3116
		dates

images
	selected
		image files
	05_08
		unsorted files
	05_09
	05_10
